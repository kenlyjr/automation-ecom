Description

Recuerda tener en cuenta:
	Revisar la pestaña TEST STRATEGY.
	La cobertura de los casos de prueba los podrá realizar aleatorios o estaticos.
	Deberá presentar sus comentarios (Jira y Github) haciendo uso de reportes y generación de evidencias.
	Deberá realizar aserciones de lo ingresado en cada input y que estos se encuentren registrados en el formulario.

El objetivo del test será aprender:
	Obtener elementos, y realizar acciones;
	Obtener elementos dentro de otros (primer reto de calendario);
	Aprender a subir archivos con Cypress
	Aprender a utilizar la librería Faker;
	Pulir el uso del POM dentro del test;

🧪Test Strategy

Challenge para QA:
	QA Automation deberá de rellenar el formulario con datos aleatorios realizando solo el happy path.
	QA deberá mantener una nomenclatura clara y objetiva.
	QA deberá intentar no repetir código (DRY)
	El test deberá de ser realizado con POM (Page Object Model) y se aplicará el uso de la librería Faker para obtener palabras y número aleatorios (guía)
Ten en cuenta que hay valores que no será necesario Faker para realizar una acción aleatoria (array’s por ejemplo)
